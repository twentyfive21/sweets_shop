# This is a Flexbox website selling beans, but will be a sweets shop in the future.

### This page I made was modeled after a figma file and I tried my best to replicate it. Here is the link to the figma file [https://www.figma.com/file/N2OuEfwY69fSymzcEBCfNh/The-Bean-Machine?node-id=2-2&t=jaitbxc7qFCY0mzF-0]if you wish to start working on this website before looking at how I implemented it! Remember practice makes perfect! This website currently has two webpages a index(homepage) and a shopping page. I also made this website responsive on all devices. I did face some challenges with the man holding the cup, input tag, and the button when CSS the main page. I will come back to this in the future and do that part in grid since that section did not work well for me with flexbox. Other than that I actually had a blast making this page and learned alot on how important it is to structure your html well so when you have to flexbox things go smoothly. I loved how this page turned out since this was my second time using flexbox.

## You will need the following knowledge to work on this site: 

### What is a figma file ? A figma file is a file that shows the design that needs to be implemented and also tells you specific CSS styles that you will need. This is a great project to take on to practice your skills on flexbox and I had a fun time making this page. 

### You will need a basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and Flexbox to make this page. This website can also be done using CSS Grid if you want to practice that skill aswell.

### Here is an explanition of the languages below if yuu are a beginner: 

### HTML stands for hypertext markup language and is used as the foundation to define the structure of webpages. To explain it in simpler terms it is the beams that hold up your house. It is used to create your paragraphs, headings, footers, and so much more.

### CSS stands for cascading style sheets and it is used to style your webpages. For example, it is the color of your walls and the decorations you have around your house. This is the language that brings your site to life and makes it look beautiful. CSS alters the size of your font, background color, and so much more. Without this your page ends up looking like you created it in microsoft word.

### From here on out I would recommend for you to make all your pages first and set up its HTML structure. Then to gather all your images and set up your git up repo before starting to CSS you page. Keep coding!
